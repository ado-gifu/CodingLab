I will use the following features while working on personal projects in C++:

- 'new' keyword: forget about malloc(), etc.
- 'auto' because I hate typing out types.
- standalone function overloading; I'm okay with it since the compiler I'm
  using appends types to non-overloaded standalone functions anyway.

This is it for now.
More notes will be added as I progress as a C++ developer.

Other than these, I want to keep my C++ pretty close to C... I do realize
modern C++ has lambdas and all sorts of interesting stuff, but I'd rather
use those in TypeScript.

In fact, I'd dare to say I want to use K&R C on steroids.
